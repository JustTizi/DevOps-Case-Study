# Math Quizzer - A DevOps Case Study

For the course DevOps &amp; Security, I had to do a case study.
In my case, I decided to create a small game in Windows Forms with a Sqlite database. The game is coded in C#.

If you want to play the game, you can download the game from the Releases tab up above, or click [here](https://github.com/JustTizi/DevOps-Case-Study/releases/tag/Release)

Thanks for checking out this repo! ☀️😎👍
